## Completing the course without class room participation

It's highly recommended to participate in the lectures because the concepts taught in the course have been generally hard for students to grasp - usually being able to ask questions and get personal support ensures success in the course. In addition to support, being present in the lectures gives you more chances to demonstrate your skills and affect your grade positively.

But if you nevertheless can not participate in the lectures, the course can be completed by doing the assignments and the project within the deadlines.

Remember to read the reading materials and slides through carefully, the information found in those should be enough to complete the exercises.
